# Idyllic
Application is still in development :smile:



The following gifs represent the current state of the application with a lot of behind the scenes things not yet shown. The first gif shows the login screen which then redirects the user to the home screen. From the home screen, the user is able to see various statistics about their listening habbits and what is currently playing (shows track audio features).
