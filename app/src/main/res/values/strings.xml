    <string name="danceability">Danceability</string>
    <string name="daceabilityDesc">
        Danceability describes how suitable a track is for dancing
        based on a combination of musical elements including tempo,
        rhythm stability, beat strength, and overall regularity.
    </string>

    <string name="liveness">Liveness</string>
    <string name="livenessDesc">
        Detects the presence of an audience in the recording.
        Higher liveness values represent an increased probability
        that the track was performed live.
    </string>

    <string name="valence">Valence</string>
    <string name="valenceDesc">
       A measure from 0.0 to 1.0 describing the musical positiveness
        conveyed by a track. Tracks with high valence sound more positive
        (e.g. happy, cheerful, euphoric), while tracks with low valence sound
        more negative (e.g. sad, depressed, angry).
    </string>

    <string name="speechiness">Speechiness</string>
    <string name="speechinessDesc">
        float 	Speechiness detects the presence of spoken words in a track.
        The more exclusively speech-like the recording (e.g. talk show, audio book, poetry),
        the closer to 1.0 the attribute value.
    </string>

    <string name="instrumentalness">Instrumentalness</string>
    <string name="instrumentalnessDesc">
        Predicts whether a track contains no vocals. “Ooh” and “aah” sounds are treated as
        instrumental in this context. Rap or spoken word tracks are clearly “vocal”.
        The closer the instrumentalness value is to 1.0, the greater likelihood the track
        contains no vocal content.

    <!-- This for the right column now -->
    <string name="loudness">Loudness</string>
    <string name="loudnessDesc">
        The overall loudness of a track in decibels (dB). Loudness values are averaged across
        the entire track and are useful for comparing relative loudness of tracks.
        Loudness is the quality of a sound that is the primary psychological correlate of physical
        strength (amplitude).
    </string>

    <string name="key">Key</string>
    <string name="keyDesc">
        The estimated overall key of the track. Integers map to pitches using standard
        Pitch Class notation . E.g. 0 = C, 1 = C♯/D♭, 2 = D, and so on.
        If no key was detected, the value is -1.
    </string>

    <string name="energy">Energy</string>
    <string name="energyDesc">
        Energy is a measure from 0.0 to 1.0 and represents a perceptual measure of intensity and
        activity. Typically, energetic tracks feel fast, loud, and noisy. For example, death metal
        has high energy, while a Bach prelude scores low on the scale.
        Perceptual features contributing to this attribute include dynamic range, perceived
        loudness, timbre, onset rate, and general entropy.
    </string>

    <string name="tempo">Tempo</string>
    <string name="tempoDesc">
        The overall estimated tempo of a track in beats per minute (BPM). In musical terminology,
        tempo is the speed or pace of a given piece and derives directly from
        the average beat duration.

    <string name="acousticness">Acousticness</string>
    <string name="acousticnessDesc">
        A confidence measure from 0.0 to 1.0 of whether the track is acoustic.
        1.0 represents high confidence the track is acoustic.
